# Stock-Trading-Bot
*A stock trading reinforcement learning bot.*

**Still very much in development, but has potential.**

As demonstrated in this image below, the model avoided many downfalls in networth when it realised that the price of the stock its trading is going down. However it is important to note that as of right now, the model is very unstable, could work well, could just be plain trash, and is just plain trash most of the time. The image below was one of the few lucky times when it worked well.
